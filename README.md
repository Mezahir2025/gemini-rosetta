## 🚀 The Mission: "Action Era" Modernization
**Gemini Rosetta** represents the pinnacle of autonomous software archaeology. In a 48-hour "Marathon Mode" sprint, this agentic system successfully ingested, analyzed, and modernized critical 90s-era legacy infrastructure (DOOM Engine & COBOL Banking Systems) without human intervention.

We don't just "refactor"—we **resurrect**.

## 🏗️ Architecture: The Antigravity Engine
At the core of Rosetta lies the **Antigravity Engine**, a multi-agent orchestration layer designed to bridge the gap between 1996 and 2026.

### 🌟 Key Capabilities
*   **1 Million Token Context Window**: Simultaneously holds the entire repository state, dependency graph, and historical context in active memory.
*   **Vibe Engineering™**: Generates not just code, but *experience*. From neon-drenched CLI dashboards to neural audio feedback, the system "feels" alive.
*   **Forensic Logic Preservation**: Detects and translates obscure bit-level hacks (fast inverse square root) into type-safe, hardware-accelerated Python 3.12+ logic.

| **`p_enemy.c`** | Unsafe Pointer Arithmetic (0x5f3759df) | **`math.sqrt` Hardware FPU** Integration | ✅ **VERIFIED** |
| **`p_mobj.c`** | Frame-Rate Dependency (35 FPS lock) | **Delta Time (dt)** Physics Logic | ✅ **VERIFIED** |
| **`s_sound.c`** | Direct Memory Access (DMA) Risks | **Web Audio API** Abstraction Layer | ✅ **VERIFIED** |
| **`p_inter.c`** | Spaghetti Logic (GOTO Hell) | **Strategy Pattern** Implementation | ✅ **VERIFIED** |
